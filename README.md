# Happy Thoughts

An X (formaly known as Twitter) project where I built a container where you can send Happy Thoughts, fetching to an external API.

### The Problem
Took me time to build it, but I am slowly understanding things and seeing structure. It took me time with the design because I am just starting to understand working with CSS. I had a lot of nice conversations with ChatGPT and my team mates.
